# Svelte FSM

`svelte-fsm` is a tiny, simple, expressive Finite State Machine library,
optimized for Svelte.

`svelte-fsm` implements Svelte's [store
contract](https://svelte.dev/docs#Store_contract). Thus, it supports Svelte's
[auto-subscription](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/auto-subscriptions) syntactic
sugar. You can certainly also use `svelte-fsm` outside of Svelte â€“ you'll just
need to manually call the `subscribe` function.

`svelte-fsm` does not depend on Svelte or any other library (except as a
`devDependency` for testing).

## Usage

Code examples coming soon.
